Part A: The purpose of this case study is to help apply the concepts associated with Frequentist inference in Python. Python code was written to apply the following statistical concepts:the z-statistic, the t-statistic, the difference and relationship between the two, the Central Limit Theorem, including its assumptions and consequences, how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample, the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean and, how to combine these concepts to calculate a confidence interval.
Part B: Involves utilizing real data instead of simulated data.
